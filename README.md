This is a browser extension for ease of navigation in the Okta Admin Console.

## Installation

1. Create a local folder in your computer named `OktaExtension`
2. Add the manifest.json and index.js files into it
3. In Chrome, go to ... -> Extensions -> Manage. Enable Developer Mode
4. Drag the OktaExtension folder to the Chrome Extensions page

## Notes
- Edit index.js if you'd like, then make sure to `Reload` the extension after saving your changes

There are a lot of opportunities to customize this extension
